# Moe's Restaurant &amp; Cafe

<p>
Moe's currently uses a Facebook page as their website. Having a non Facebook solution would allow Moe's to customize their page further and allow for the potential of online ordering.
</p>

<p>
A finished version of the website would contain store information such as hours of operation and location, the full food menu, and a starting setup for online ordering.
