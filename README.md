# Moe's Restaurant &amp; Cafe

<p>
Moe's currently uses a Facebook page as their website. Having a non Facebook solution would allow Moe's to customize their page further and allow for the potential of online ordering.
</p>

<p>
A finished version of the website would contain store information such as hours of operation and location, the full food menu, and a starting setup for online ordering.

<p>
Some other local restaurants' websites are:
  <ul>
    <li>http://www.atasteofmemphis.com/</li>
    <li>http://www.angelospizzaonline.com/</li>
    <li>http://www.brandonsbbq.com</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
A chain restaurant's website is:
  <ul>
    <li>https://www.olivegarden.com/home</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
These websites are good examples of well designed websites because they are:
  <ul>
    <li>Visually appealing</li>
    <li>Easy to navigate</li>
    <li>Contain necessary store info and hours</li>
    <li>Contain a food menu</li>
    <li>Contain links to order online.</li>
  </ul>
